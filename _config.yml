  I am a passionate master's graduate in Biomedical Imaging with strong technical and interpersonal skills. I have experience in health technology, machine learning, computer vision, and image & signal processing. I seek to make a positive impact on people's lives through research and innovation.
  
  Currently, I am a prospective Ph.D. candidate, eagerly anticipating the start of an industrial Ph.D. fellowship in the [<mark>LABDA</mark>](https://labda-project.eu/index.html) (Learning Network for Advanced Behavioural Data Analysis) project starting October 2023. 
  
  This prestigious fellowship is a part of the MSCA (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions) Doctoral Network, under [Horizon Europe (2021-2027)](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/document/horizon-europe-work-programme-2021-2022-marie-sklodowska-curie-actions).

  My upcoming research will generally focus on the analysis of multi-source advanced behavioral data where I will have specific responsibilities to:
  
    - Present findings at (inter)national meetings/conferences.
    - Contribute to educational activities within the consortium.
    - Report on findings by publishing scientific articles, resulting in a dissertation.
    - Contribute to the LABDA toolbox of advanced analysis methods for sensor-based behavioral data.    
    - Conduct a feasibility test with the improved multi-source movement behavior data collection method.
    - Further develop an existing smartphone application to be able to combine accelerometer data with contextual data collected using GPS and/or EMA functionality.
    - Assess the possibility of enhancing behavioral classification accuracy using data from additional sources and implement the improved classification algorithm.
    - Systematically assess the benefits and drawbacks of existing multi-source movement behavior data methods where accelerometer data are combined with other data to improve classification accuracy and/or add contextual information.

  Through these research endeavors, I aspire to make meaningful contributions to the field of multi-source behavioral data analysis, paving the way for innovative applications and advancements that can improve people's lives and lead to meaningful changes in how we approach behavioral analysis. 

  As a research-driven and target-oriented individual, I am committed to bridging the gap between science and industry. My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact across various domains and advance our understanding of human behavior.

  Through collaboration and knowledge sharing within the LABDA consortium, I am excited to be part of a transformative journey that pushes the boundaries of data analysis and contributes to the progress of human-centric research.

  Stay tuned for updates on my exciting journey as I embark on this research endeavor!

      On a personal level, I am like a Swiss Army knife of reliability and collaboration. I am well-organized, detail-oriented, and always eager to tackle new challenges. I have a strong sense of initiative, which I believe is essential for problem-solving and skill development.
      
      Although I value teamwork, I am also comfortable working independently. My goal is not only to achieve personal success but also to help the team achieve success and make a significant impact. I thrive in challenging environments and enjoy taking on new and complex tasks.
      
      In my free time, I enjoy puzzles 🧩, data mining 🖥️, finance 💹, reading 📚, cooking 👨‍🍳, and the outdoors 🌲🌅🏖️🚴✈️. I’m always seeking to expand my skills and knowledge 📈. Please explore 🔎 my site to learn more about my background, projects, and research interests 🔬. I’m open to collaborations 🤝, so feel free to connect! 😀
