  I am a passionate master's graduate in Biomedical Imaging with strong technical and interpersonal skills. I have experience in health technology, machine learning, computer vision, image & signal processing, and am seeking to make a positive impact on people's lives.
  
  I recently completed my MSc in Biomedical Imaging at the University of Turku in Finland, where my thesis focused on camera-based heart rate extraction in noisy environments. I developed a modular pipeline to extract accurate heart rate signals from video recordings in challenging conditions.
  
  Previously, I obtained my BSc in Physics from Azad University in Iran. My undergraduate project evaluated the impact of pavement and vegetation on urban noise reduction.
  
  I have research experience interning at the Cell Migration Lab at Ã…bo Akademi University, where I worked on developing deep learning-backed segmentation networks. I have also interned at an optics lab where I gained hands-on experience with optical equipment and quality control.
  
  In addition to research, I have professional experience as a Quality Controller at an automotive manufacturer and as a Computer Operator at a medical imaging center. These roles allowed me to develop my technical abilities and attention to detail.
  
  Outside of work, I enjoy puzzles, data mining, outdoor activities, reading, cooking and coding. I consider myself hard-working, curious, self-initiated, trustworthy and results-driven. I am looking to utilize my diverse background to advance innovation in health technology and computer vision.
  
  Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand this "About Me" section further based on Amin's resume and experience!

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
