  I am an enthusiastic Biomedical Imaging master's graduate with a strong skill set in technical and interpersonal areas. My expertise encompasses health technology, machine learning, computer vision, and image & signal processing. My ultimate aim is to contribute to research and innovation that positively impacts people's lives.
  
  Currently, I am eagerly anticipating the start of an industrial Ph.D. fellowship in the [<mark>LABDA</mark>](https://labda-project.eu/index.html) (Learning Network for Advanced Behavioural Data Analysis) project, set to begin in October 2023. This prestigious fellowship is part of the MSCA (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions) Doctoral Network, funded under [Horizon Europe (2021-2027)](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/document/horizon-europe-work-programme-2021-2022-marie-sklodowska-curie-actions).
  
  My upcoming research will generally focus on the analysis of multi-source advanced behavioral data. Within this domain, I will have specific responsibilities, including presenting findings at (inter)national meetings/conferences, contributing to educational activities within the consortium, and publishing scientific articles resulting in a dissertation. 
  
  Additionally, I will be contributing to the LABDA toolbox of advanced analysis methods for sensor-based behavioral data, conducting feasibility tests with an improved multi-source movement behavior data collection method, and further developing a smartphone application to combine accelerometer data with contextual information from GPS and/or EMA functionality. 
  
  I will also assess the potential of enhancing behavioral classification accuracy using data from additional sources and implementing improved classification algorithms. Moreover, I will systematically evaluate existing multi-source movement behavior data methods that involve combining accelerometer data with other information to improve classification accuracy and add contextual insights.
  
  Through these research endeavors, I aspire to make meaningful contributions to the field of multi-source behavioral data analysis, paving the way for innovative applications and advancements that can improve people's lives and lead to meaningful changes in how we approach behavioral analysis. 

  As a research-driven and target-oriented individual, I am committed to bridging the gap between science and industry. My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact across various domains and advance our understanding of human behavior.

  I am thrilled to collaborate and share knowledge within the LABDA consortium, embarking on a transformative journey that pushes the boundaries of data analysis and contributes to human-centric research.

  Stay tuned for updates on my exciting journey as I embark on this research endeavor!

          During my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to explore the captivating world of imaging technologies and their transformative applications in the field of biomedicine. Through a carefully crafted curriculum, I gained extensive knowledge and practical expertise in a diverse range of topics, spanning from cutting-edge imaging techniques to advanced biomedical instrumentation and bioimaging informatics. Immersed in this interdisciplinary journey, I honed my statistical skills and cultivated a keen understanding of how to derive valuable insights from complex biomedical data.

          One of the highlights of the program was the freedom to tailor my studies through selectable major courses. I chose to specialize in areas that ignited my curiosity, such as programming for image analysis and innovative design thinking. These experiences provided me with a solid foundation in utilizing artificial intelligence and sophisticated visualization tools to process, interpret, and present intricate biomedical information effectively.

          As I pursued my passion for merging technology and healthcare, I discovered the power of AI-driven imaging solutions in driving progress and revolutionizing patient care. The program not only expanded my technical prowess but also nurtured a profound appreciation for the profound impact of biomedical imaging on human well-being.
